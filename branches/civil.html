            Civil Engineering is one of the oldest and broadest branches of engineering, focusing on the design, construction, and maintenance of infrastructure projects. This includes buildings, roads, bridges, dams, water supply systems, and more. Civil engineers play a vital role in shaping the built environment and ensuring the safety, sustainability, and functionality of public infrastructure. The curriculum covers topics like structural analysis, materials science, geotechnical engineering, transportation engineering, and environmental engineering. Civil engineering students are trained to use advanced tools and techniques for planning, designing, and executing large-scale projects. The branch offers diverse career opportunities in construction, urban planning, and environmental management
            <br><br>
           
Civil Engineering integrates scientific principles with practical applications to solve challenges related to the construction and development of infrastructure. Students in this field learn to design and manage construction projects, ensuring that they meet safety standards, sustainability goals, and community needs. The field encompasses various specializations such as structural engineering, environmental engineering, transportation engineering, and water resources management
