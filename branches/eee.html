Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE) is a dynamic branch of engineering that focuses on the study and application of electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism in various systems. It deals with the design, development, and maintenance of electrical systems and electronic devices used in industries, transportation, communication, and power generation. The EEE branch covers subjects such as circuit theory, power systems, control systems, signal processing, and semiconductor devices. Students gain a strong foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects, enabling them to work with electrical networks, electronic components, and automation systems in a variety of sectors, including energy, telecommunications, and electronics manufacturing
            <br><br>
            The EEE branch also emphasizes emerging technologies such as renewable energy, electric vehicles, and smart grids. Students are exposed to the latest advancements in energy-efficient systems, automation, and digital electronics. With a deep understanding of electrical circuits, power generation, and electronic devices, EEE graduates are well-prepared to solve complex problems and contribute to innovations in power systems, robotics, and communication technologies. As industries continue to evolve with the advent of automation and smart technologies, the demand for skilled EEE professionals remains high, making this branch a critical field in the modern engineering landscape.
